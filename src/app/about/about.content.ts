    `Hackapet is a group of programmers that are developing an open-source and non-profit project for animal shelters in valencia.`,
    `Currently I am leading the web development team, making key decisions in front-end and back-end. Additionally, I am teaching beginners the fundamentals of web development, best practices, and how to contribute to and build the project effectively.`,

    `The project is compounded by three phases. The first one, currently in development, 
    focuses on building an app that helps the shelters to manage and digitalize the data from all animals, This will make information easily accessible on smartphones, eliminating the need for inconvenient tools like Excel or pen and paper.`,

    `After meeting with a volunteer of a shelter, we discovered that most of shelters, at least in valencia, still rely on handwritten records. Moreover, the task of promoting animals on social media is often handled manually by someone unfamiliar with how to efficiently upload content across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and X`,

    `This is where the second phase begins. Its goal is to create a dedicated social media platform, similar to Wallapop or Idealista,  that leverages the data collected in the first phase.This will allow users to search for a furry friend that matches their needs, such as a cat suited for apartment living or a Great Dane that loves playing in a backjard.`,

    `Finaly, the third phase, involves a catching up system to ensure that the animal is adapting well to its new home and that the owner is happy with their new companion.`
